# BrewWatcher

A little tool for watching and logging your brewing
temperatures.

# Why?

I was looking to get into hardware hacking so figured
this would be the easiest way to do it.

# Whats Required?

My project consists of the following:

- Raspberry Pi for logging/reporting
- Arduino for taking the readings
- DS1307 Real Time Clock for generating timestamps
- DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor for temperature readings

There are probably a few other things, but this is all that's needed for the headless version.

# Languages

 - Arduino for all that electronics stuffs
 - golang for something... don't know quite what
 - ruby as my crutch while learning golang
   - I actually want to get this thing done somewhat quickly!
